<h2>Highlights</h2>
Here are a few highlights of my career, that I feel are interesting enough to share:
- I have worked on India's [AEW&CS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRDO_AEW%26CS) program. A lot of interesting assignments came my way in this project.
- I have 20+ hours of Radar flight test experience.
- I worked on keyword spotting for multiple smartphone manufacturers. This is a use-case of waking up one's phone a phrase. Think "alexa" or "hi, siri". Uses a combination of speech processing and machine learning.
