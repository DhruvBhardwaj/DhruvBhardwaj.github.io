<h2>Staff Engineer</h2>
<h4>
<a href="https://www.knowles.com/">Audience Communications (A Knowles Company)</a>

</h4>

I was part of the **VoiceIQ** Algorithms Productization team. <br>

VoiceIQ was Audienceâ€™s [solution](https://www.knowles.com/applications/mobile-solutions) for low power spoken keyword recognition ([Voice Wake](https://www.mouser.in/new/knowles/knowles-ia611-processor/)) in smartphones and home devices.
<br>
<br>
My role included the following activities:
- Data pre-processing and fine-tuning of Machine Learning based algorithms.
- Evaluating performance in various distractor scenarios (car, babble, rain etc.)
- On device training algorithm improvements based on customer requirements.
- Generic algorithm improvements/research to improve performance.
- Single point of contact for VoiceIQ algorithms team in India.


<br>
Few highlights of my work:
- Two design wins from major mobile OEMs in 2017-18, with in-lab accuracy for voice wake improved upto 94% in babble distractor scenarios.
- One US [Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2019246314A1/en?oq=WO2019246314A1) resulted from my work on variable thresholding based on SNR measurements at run-time.
- My **research** work included modelling multi-microphone topologies for IoT devices. With this I worked on predicting microphone [beamforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming) performance in different cases for diffuse and directional distractors.
