<h4>Defence Research and Development Organisation</h4>

I was part of Systems Group (Radar-F division), focused at the development of Primary Radar for [Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AEW&CS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRDO_AEW%26CS) for the Indian Air Force.

The group carried out system level design, algorithm development and performance modelling for the Radar signal and data processors.
<br>
Spcifically, my contributions were as follows:
- Conducted modeling and simulation of Radar signal processing chain for AEW&CS system
- Simulation airborne Radar performance in the presence of [clutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutter_(radar)) (ground clutter modeling).
- Simulation and performance evaluation for classical and [adaptive beamforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_beamformer) for the Radarâ€™s phased array system.
- Implemented C-based detection clustering and map-based algorithm which determines air-sea boundary in real-time.
- In charge for integration and evaluation of Radar Target Simulator (RTS), an automated setup for testing performance parameters and use cases for a Radar system.
- Participated in field trials for the Radar. 20+ Hours of flight test experience.
- Active participant in two Preliminary Design Reviews and one Critical Design Review of Radar systems.
