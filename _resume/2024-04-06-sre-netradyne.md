<h2>Staff Research Engineer</h2>
<h4>
<a href="https://www.netradyne.com/">Netradyne Technology Pvt. Ltd.</a>

</h4>

At Netradyne, I was (loosely) responsible for:
- Developing systems and algorithms for new products/initiatives.
- Design and experiment deep learning based solutions that are relevant to our problems.
- Research current literature for techniques which may be relevant to our products.
- Mentor junior colleagues in day-to-day technical work.
<br>

My current work focuses on **driver drowsiness detection**. For this, I am worked on the following:
- Details of the resulting product are here: [Driver Drowsiness with DMS Sensor](https://www.netradyne.com/products/driver-drowsiness-with-dms-sensor)
- Identify and build deep learning models to extract eye features which can be used to detect drowsiness.
- Develop classical signal processing algorithms with known drowsy markers, that can be used in real-time detection.
- Manage lab and field collected data and analyse it.
