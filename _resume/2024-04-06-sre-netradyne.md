<h2>Staff Research Engineer</h2>
<h4>Netradyne Technology Pvt. Ltd.</h4>

At Netradyne, I am (loosely) responsible for:
- Developing systems and algorithms for new products/initiatives.
- Design and experiment deep learning based solutions that are relevant to our problems.
- Research current literature for techniques which may be relevant to our products.
- Mentor junior colleagues in day-to-day technical work.

My current work focuses on **driver drowsiness detection**. For this, I am working on the following:
- Identify and build deep learning models to extract eye features which can be used to detect drowsiness.
- Develop classical signal processing algorithms with known drowsy markers, that can be used in real-time detection.
- Manage lab and field collected data and analyse it.
